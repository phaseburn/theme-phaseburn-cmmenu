This is the CM Menu theme for the T-Mobile Theme Engine. It replaces the 
"Home" softmenu button image with Cid's head. To compile it, make sure your
key.properties and local.properties files are in order, and just simply
execute "ant release" after you've added/removed the images and written your
XML appropriately.
